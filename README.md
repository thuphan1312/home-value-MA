# Effects of Median Income and Nearby College Size to Home Value in MA!
I aimed to find the correlation and effects of median income and college size on home values in Massachusetts as defined by Zip code tabulation areas. This is inspired by how homes near UMass in Amherst and near Smith College in Northampton are crazy expensive. It seems to be a common theme I discovered as I looked at home values near Harvard and MIT. Home values in Sommerville and Cambridge are all significantly higher than that of Dorchester, a similar Boston suburb that is not close to a large college. Moreover, I am fairly convinced that those who have the financial resource to purchase homes near colleges to turn into a rental must have very good income considering the rising cost of off-campus housing, which I have experienced personally.

Overall, the model agreed with my hypothesis that homes near large colleges are much higher in value. Moreover, areas with high median income correlate to high home values. Maybe my future investment will be a house in downtown Amherst!
